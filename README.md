# Welcome

### This is my first project

##### In this project I was required to build a static website using only HTML and CSS

#### Brief

Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper). You can use either your assets or the assets within the following GitHub repo.

The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:

Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.

Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:

Photos of the band members, a video clip, audio clips

Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.
