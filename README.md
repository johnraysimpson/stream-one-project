# Welcome

### This is my first project

##### In this project I was required to build a static website using only HTML and CSS

#### Brief

Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper). You can use either your assets or the assets within the following GitHub repo.

The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:

Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.

Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:

Photos of the band members, a video clip, audio clips

Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.

#### Development

This project was designed to target the fans of the band and potential fans. I think this hits the brief well as it the project has independent pages for music, video and a booking enquiry for events.

I used Bootstrap's framework for CSS in order to create a responsive, mobile-first project and made stylistic changes using my own CSS code and two Google Fonts.

All HTML code was written by myself. Each page of this project was created in the order they appear in the navigation.

I made good use of the assets that were provided for this project, all other images were found for different, free stock image and clipart websites.

I made decisions early on using a wireframe from pen and paper. I wanted to set myself the challenge of creating a vertical navigation bar from the offset which I succeeded in doing, then later felt that the hover effects would be lost on tablets and phones and made an alternative navigation section for these.

I initially thought I should make the home page about the band itself to make use of the photos I was given. Later I felt this would look better as its own "About Us" page and replaced the content on the home page with fictional news and reviews like other band sites include. I felt this was a good design choice as it is a layout that users are accustomed to. The links under "news" and the first two under "reviews" will open a new tab and redisplay homepage. It shows the behaviour it would have if they had links to follow.

I made sure to include any additional links to social media (other than the footer) where approriate, these can be found on the "Listen" and "Watch" page. There are links in the "user" reviews on the homepage that takes the user to the booking page.

I tested the project myself, and I also asked 3 others to look at it. One had no knowledge of web design, another is a fan of the band with some technical knowledge and another has a background in software. It was good to ask these people as they have different viewpoints of the project which gave me a variety of feedback.

There were some aspects in this project that I wanted to change but I found the lack of use of JavaScript constrained these. Examples include changing how the media players looked and having each band member's biography in seperate tabs rather than the stacked layout they currently have.
