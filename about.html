                <p class="text-center">The Monkees were an American rock and pop band originally 
                active between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades 
                that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert 
                Schneider for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. 
                The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and 
                Peter Tork and British stage and television actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music 
                was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy 
                Boyce and Bobby Hart.</p>

                <h3>Micky Dolenz</h3>
                <img class="member-image-left" src="assets/images/md.jpg" alt="Mickey Dolenz"></img>
                <p>Dolenz began his show-business career in 1956 when he starred in a children's show called 
                Circus Boy under the name Mickey Braddock. He played Corky, an orphaned water boy for the 
                elephants in a one-ring circus at the start of the 20th century. The program ran for two 
                seasons, after which Dolenz made sporadic appearances on network television shows and pursued 
                his education. Dolenz went to Ulysses S. Grant High School in Valley Glen, Los Angeles, 
                California, and graduated in 1962. In 1964, he was cast as Ed in the episode "Born of Kings 
                and Angels" of the NBC education drama series, Mr. Novak, starring James Franciscus as an 
                idealistic Los Angeles teacher. Dolenz was attending college in Los Angeles when he was 
                hired for the "drummer" role in NBC's The Monkees.</p>

                <h3>Michael Nesmith</h3>
                <img class="member-image-right" src="assets/images/mn.jpg" alt="Michael Nesmith"></img>
                <p>Nesmith was born in Houston, Texas, in 1942. He is an only child; his parents, Warren 
                Audrey Nesmith and Bette Nesmith Graham, divorced when their son was four. He and his mother 
                moved to Dallas to be closer to her parents, sister, aunts, and grandmother.  When Nesmith was 
                13, his mother invented the typewriter correction fluid later known commercially as Liquid 
                Paper. Over the next 25 years she built the Liquid Paper Corporation into a multimillion-dollar 
                international company, which she finally sold to Gillette in 1979 for US$48 million. After a 
                tour of duty in the Air Force, Nesmith was given a guitar as a Christmas present from his mother 
                and stepfather, learning as he went. Nesmith began his recording career in 1963 by releasing a 
                single on the Highness label. He followed this in 1965 with a one-off single released on Edan 
                Records followed by two more recorded singles; one was titled "The New Recruit" under the name 
                "Michael Blessing", released on Colpix Records, coincidentally also the label of Davy Jones, though 
                they did not meet until the Monkees formed.</p>

                <h3>Peter Tork</h3>
                <img class="member-image-left" src="assets/images/pt.jpg" alt="Peter Tork"></img>
                <p>Tork was born at the former Doctors Hospital, in Washington, D.C. Although he was born in 
                the District of Columbia in 1942, many news articles incorrectly report him as born in 1944 
                in New York City, which was the date and place given on early Monkees press releases. He attended 
                Carleton College before he moved to New York City, where he became part of the folk music scene 
                in Greenwich Village during the first half of the 1960s. While there, he befriended other 
                up-and-coming musicians such as Stephen Stills. Stephen Stills had auditioned for the new 
                television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers 
                felt his hair and teeth would not photograph well on camera. They asked Stills if he knew of 
                someone with a similar "open, Nordic look," and Stills suggested Tork audition for the part. Tork 
                got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a fictitious pop band in the 
                mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom written about the fictitious band. Tork was the oldest 
                member of the group.</p>

                <h3>Davy Jones</h3>
                <img class="member-image-right" src="assets/images/dj.jpg" alt="Davy Jones"></img>
                <p>David Thomas Jones was born at 20 Leamington Street, Openshaw, Manchester, Lancashire, England, 
                on 30 December 1945. His television acting debut was on the British television soap opera Coronation 
                Street. After the death of his mother from emphysema when he was 14 years old, Jones rejected 
                acting in favour of a career as a jockey, apprenticing with Newmarket trainer Basil Foster. Foster 
                was approached by a friend who worked in a theatre in the West End of London during casting for the 
                musical Oliver!. Foster replied, "I've got the kid." Jones was cast and appeared to great acclaim as 
                the Artful Dodger. He played the role in London and then on Broadway and was nominated for a Tony 
                Award. On 9 February 1964, he appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show with Georgia Brown who was playing Nancy 
                in the Broadway production of Oliver!. This was the same episode of the show in which the Beatles made 
                their first appearance. Jones said of that night, "I watched the Beatles from the side of the stage, I saw 
                the girls going crazy, and I said to myself, this is it, I want a piece of that." Jones debuted on the 
                Billboard Hot 100 in the week of 14 August 1965, with the single "What Are We Going To Do?" The 19-year-old 
                singer was signed to Colpix Records, a label owned by Columbia. From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of 
                the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name.</p>
